## Simple markdown to HTML Compiler

This was a fun challenge.  Basically a black-box reverse engineer of a markdown to html compiler.  

You should absolutely not use this for anything.  There is no shortage of well done compiler/transpiler/parsers out there.  After all, markdown was designed from the ground up to be compiled to HTML.  This was just a learning experience.  And I learned a ton.
